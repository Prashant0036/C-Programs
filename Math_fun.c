/*Math Functions
There is also a list of math functions available, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

To use them, you must include the math.h header file in your program:

#include <math.h>
Square Root
To find the square root of a number, use the sqrt() function:

Example
printf("%f", sqrt(16));
Round a Number
The ceil() function rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer, and the floor() method rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result:

Example
printf("%f", ceil(1.4));
printf("%f", floor(1.4));
Power
The pow() function returns the value of x to the power of y (xy):

Example
printf("%f", pow(4, 3));
Other Math Functions
A list of other popular math functions (from the <math.h> library) can be found in the table below:

Function	Description
abs(x)	Returns the absolute value of x
acos(x)	Returns the arccosine of x
asin(x)	Returns the arcsine of x
atan(x)	Returns the arctangent of x
cbrt(x)	Returns the cube root of x
cos(x)	Returns the cosine of x
exp(x)	Returns the value of Ex
sin(x)	Returns the sine of x (x is in radians)
tan(x)	Returns the tangent of an angle
